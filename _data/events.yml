    presenter: "Gautam Baghel, Synopsys & Dan Cornell, ThreadFix"
    overview: |
      ThreadFix is a leading solution for managing your application vulnerability data across static, dynamic, interactive tests, and open source software. Black Duck®, a premiere software composition analysis tool, provides insight into the vulnerabilities in your open source application portfolio. Together, Black Duck and ThreadFix create a unified view of your application security program. In this webinar, learn how ThreadFix can provide valuable remediation guidance for the open source vulnerabilities uncovered by Black Duck—and from static and dynamic tests as well. ThreadFix sends all that information automatically to your developers, so they can spend their time resolving issues, not trying to research how.
