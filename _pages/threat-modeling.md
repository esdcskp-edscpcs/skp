# Threat Modeling explained

Threat modelling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value.

Threat modelling can be applied to a wide range of things, including software, applications, systems, networks, distributed systems, things in the internet of things, business processes, etc. There are very few technical products which cannot be threat modelled; more or less rewarding, depending on how much it communicates, or interacts, with the world. Threat modelling can be done at any stage of development, preferably early - so that the findings can inform the design.

OWASP Threat Dragon (TD) is a tool used to create threat model diagrams and to record possible threats and decide on their mitigations.

TD is both an online threat modelling web application and a desktop application, and includes system diagramming and a rule engine to auto-generate threats/mitigations. The focus of TD is on great UX, a powerful rule engine and alignment with other development lifecycle tools.
