# Security Champions Overview

## Background
IT Security is implementing Security by Design which is an is an approach to software and hardware development that seeks to make systems as free of vulnerabilities and impervious to attack as possible.  It is the process that integrates security in the system development lifecycle process (SDLC).  Given today’s dynamic threat environment IT Security can no longer be an afterthought. IITB is therefore integrating Security by Design within ESDC’s SDLC process. This means: 
*  Project applications to build security in risk-based design; have system-specific security controls and produce security assurance evidence.
*  IT Security to collaborate with the Solution Team to ensure Security Requirements are applied to the Business Solution; assess security assurance evidence and authorize application operation. 

## The Security Champion Objectives
*  To be the Point of Contact representing IT Security in their Solution Team/ Application Development team;
*  To grow into the Security subject-matter expert in the development / solution or project team;
*  To become a security influencer and promote the department’s security agenda;
*  To remind developers that application security is their responsibility. 

## Roles and Responsibilities as a Security Champion
### Roles and Responsibilities

- Implementing and managing security tools;
- Validating and assigning vulnerabilities for mitigation;
- Ensuring all documentation is created for security; 
- Performing threat modeling on the architecture and the new functionality.
- Responsible to ensure Security Requirements and Controls are implemented in solutions
- Notify IT Security of any potential risk driven by any kind of additions/changes made to a solution (Architecture, components, third party solutions, etc.)
- Knowledge sharing with the team
- Keep up-to-date with Security Training / Awareness / Guidance / Mentoring
- Promote best practices
- Participate actively in a network of Security Champions. 

### Implementing and managing security tools

You will have the responsibility to demonstrate to developers how to integrate and configure various application security tools into their CI/CD pipeline and support them if required.

- [Application Security Tools & Guides]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}app-security-tools/)

### Training

Customized training will be offered to the Security Champions and will be provided at a date to be determined. The training will touch on the following topics:

- Security by design
- ITSG-33 Security Controls;
- Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) walkthrough;
- Security Assessment & Authorization (SA&A) walkthrough;
- Threat Modeling.

Additional security training is strongly recommended. You can find a list of recommended courses below. Group sessions may be held at specific dates.

- [Security Training]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}app-security-training/)

### Collaboration

As a Security Champion, you will be invited to share security information and collaborate on the various platforms of the **Security Champions Network**:


- [GCConnex](https://gcconnex.gc.ca/groups/profile/59572173/esdc-security-champions-network-reseau-des-champions-de-la-securite-dedsc?language=en)
- [Security Champions Network on MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aaa7f40a6029a44cdbf864f7dc8bc5a62%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=bea80905-7f0f-432d-9a83-60561c1efcd2&tenantId=9ed55846-8a81-4246-acd8-b1a01abfc0d1)
- Use and promote the Security Knowledge Base (upcoming)

## Security Tools Management

- Security Tools implementation strategy

## The End Goal
**Security by Design is a partnership between Business, IITB Solution Team and IT Security.**
The shared objective is a securely delivered and a securely operated IT solution.  This will be done by having Security Champions: 
* become Security influencers to promote the Department’s Security agenda;
* work with their teams and collaborate with IT Security subject matter experts to ensure that security is an integral and continuous part of the development lifecycle. 
Doing so will allow IITB to conform to the Treasury Board Directive on Security Management, the Policy on Government Security and align with the IT Security Risk Management – A Lifecycle Approach (ITSG-33).

## Getting to know our Partners
### Business
**Business Requirements**
* Identifies needs and risk tolerance
* Completes Business Needs Document and Security Assessment Questionnaire
* Confirms Statement of Sensitivity and Statement of Acceptable Risk
* Leads Privacy Impact Assessment activities 
* Reviews Security Assessment Report and completes the Risk Mitigation Plan
* Jointly signed Statement of Authorization by the Business Line ADM and IITB CIO. 

### The IT Security Teams 
**The Solution Team** works with IT Security to implement all departmental and GoC Security. **Requirements include**:
* Incorporating Baseline Security Requirements into the Conceptual Design **at the start of the project**
* Develop Conceptual Security Design to include Security Architecture, Security Controls and Security Mechanisms
* Review Security Testing and Evaluation and Preliminary Security Assessment Reports
* Updates the Security Requirements Traceability Matrix
* Completes the Residual Risk Mitigation Plan.
* The Solution team also works in partnership with the Business to provide input on Business required documents such as the Security Questionnaire and Testing and Evaluation reports.

**The SA&A Team** is responsible to:
* Defines Sensitivity and Acceptable Risk
* Leverages Enterprise Level Threat Assessment, Information Asset Sensitivity and Business Impact Assessments from Integrity Services Branch.

* Assess the Conceptual Security Design
* Security Testing and Evaluation.

**The Engineering Team** is responsible to:
* Assesses the Conceptual Security Design
* Tailor Security Controls 
* Assess Security Architecture
* Assess Security Controls 

## Security Assessment Approach
**Approach for NEW Solutions - Applies to New or Major Release/Version:**
* Solution Development Team engages IT Security Team at START of project
* Project to produce full set of requisite evidence documents
* Excellent ability for IT Security to influence security (requirements/controls)
* Excellent opportunity for security design review, escalation of deficiencies during the build phase. 

**Approach for EXISTING Solutions:**
* Current focus is on mission critical applications, Citizen centric apps, high privacy/security concerns
* Existing applications will be assessed for compliance, then triaged for risk mitigation action
* Utilize Application Portfolio Management (APM) and Corporate Solution Directory (CSD) to identify applications
* Utilize Business Impact Assessments (BIA) for criticality and availability
* Identify Security Assurance Level, Categorize and Prioritize 
* Conduct Compliance Assessment against required safeguards/controls
* High Residual Risk solutions to be triaged for attention and action.
